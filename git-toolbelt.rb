# Homebrew formula for the git-toolbelt fork (github.com/sdthach/git-toolbelt).
#
# This file is the source of truth. The tap copy lives in
# github.com/sdthach/homebrew-tap/git-toolbelt.rb and is kept in sync by
# .github/workflows/release.yml (see docs/maintaining-the-fork.md).
#
# Homebrew and mise install the SAME artifact: the `git-toolbelt-X.Y.Z.tar.gz`
# release asset built by scripts/build-dist.sh, which already ships its commands
# flattened into bin/. That keeps the two distribution paths from drifting —
# there is one tarball, one sha256, and one layout to reason about.
#
# INSTALL
#   Stable (pinned release):  brew install sdthach/tap/git-toolbelt
#   HEAD (tip of main):       brew install --HEAD sdthach/tap/git-toolbelt
